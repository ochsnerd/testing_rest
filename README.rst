Testing out how restructuredText works together with Sphinx
===========================================================
Using example code from http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils/statemachine.py,
and adapted the sphinx example from here: https://github.com/timstaley/sphinx-example.

Structure
---------
The structure is as follows::

    Root
    |-- code
    |   |-- example.py  python sourcecode documented using rst-formatted docstrings
    |-- docs
        |-- Makefile    autogenerated makefile from Sphinx
        |-- source
        |   |-- index.rst   'master'-file from documentation, contains for example the index
        |   ...             more Sphinx folders, a config.py-file
        |   ...             user-written .rst files. They can "link" to sourcecode to automatically include functions+their docstring
        |-- build           output from Sphinx shows up here, for example html or pdf
        
Usage
-----
In the docs-folder, run for example::

    make html

The html-files of the documentation can then be found in docs/build/html .
